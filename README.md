# CROWDFUNDING-KICKSTARTER-PROJECT
In this project, the Kickstarter crowdfunding dataset was analyzed to extract key insights and build visualizations using Power BI, Excel, and SQL. Dates were converted from Epoch time to natural time, and a Calendar Table was created with Year, Month, Quarter, Weekday, and Financial Month/Quarter columns. A data model was built from the Excel files, and project goals were standardized in USD. Key analyses included total projects by outcome, location, category, and time; metrics for successful projects such as amount raised, number of backers, and average duration; top projects based on backers and funding; and the percentage of successful projects overall, by category, time period, and goal range.
